# Security/Privacy
I promise I'm not doing any tricky/creepy shit. The total source of the project is like 30 lines. You can go read it above if you don't believe me.

# Requirements
This extension won't really work unless it's allowed in Incognito mode. To enable this you must go to your extensions menu, find Can Opener, and find the toggle for allowing in Incognito.
